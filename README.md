There are slides for my series of lectures for
[Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/) (Kazan, Russia).

All recorded videos are in [this YouTube playlist][playlist].

All compiled slide decks in PDF are [here](https://yegor256.github.io/pmba/).

Research questions
[are here](https://gist.github.com/yegor256/3d04cb381d3df26aa99e965e20cf11ef).

To compile everything just run:

```bash
make
```

To clean everything up, do:

```bash
make clean
```

You need to have
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
[`aspell`](http://aspell.net/),
and
[`texsc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texsc)
installed.
